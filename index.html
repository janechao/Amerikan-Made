        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Amerikan Made Prints has been a small screen printing studio for a couple of years now, and it consists of myself and my wife, Jenn. Together, our goal is to turn out hand-printed posters that rock harder than Gibraltar. </p>

        <h2>Happy Hiatus</h2>
        <p>During our second year, just as we were hitting a great stride, we decided to take a hiatus to concentrate our attention on our biggest project: the birth of our son.</p>

        <h2>Happy Hiatus</h2>
        <p>It’s now been 4 years since his birth and almost two years on hiatus. The urge to return to the life of laying down ink is too strong to ignore. It’s a part of our life that we are very passionate about and it has sorely been missed. Those who have followed our adventures know that we are basically a D.I.Y. shop using handmade equipment. Unfortunately the exposure unit, our most important piece of equipment, has become unreliable and needs to be replaced. It's especially apparent when our poster designs call for high detail or halftones. Also, most of our supplies such as emulsion, ink, paper and shipping supplies need to be replenished.</p>
